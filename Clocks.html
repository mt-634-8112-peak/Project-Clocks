When I first started thinking about the design, I had many ideas floating in my head. Before I settled on the current final design, I was considering a capacitor timer circuit, a quartz crystall resonator, or using a 555 integrated circuit, as well as the Arduino microcontroller idea that I stuck with. The reason I discarded the other ideas is because they added far too much excessive complexity to the circuit, and completely elimated the realm of coding, which was something I wanted to keep in the project. They required more parts, had less reusability value, were harder to assemble, and were harder to keep time accurately with. On the other hand, the Arduino was engineered to be very efficient, simple, and fully featured, making it the clear best choice for my purposes. The design uses the Arduinos to control the logic of the timekeeping functions. I connected wires from the pins on the arduino to power the circuitry. I ran into some issues using certain pin configurations for the clock on the left, which is why the wiring may look a bit strange, but the current wiring configuration seems to be the optimal one. I would have liked to optimize the wires and use serialized complex data instead, but that would have required some form of memory to store the full data and process it, which is extremely difficult and would have added a lot of meaningless complication to the circuit. It just makes more sense to directly send specific voltages individually, which just maps on and off to each pin for every state. The potentiometer is simply used to adjust the dimmness of the display. The slide switch controls the flow of power back to the Arduino board. I coded the Arduino so that when it detects power/no power, it will change which numbers it will display. It repeats a cycle every second, because it has the flashing dot indicator turning on and off for half a second continously. The code tracks 6 cycles to update the tenth of a second unit, which is tracked for ten updates to update another counter which triggers a tenth of a minute update when it reaches 6. The tenth of a minute also triggers the hour update after 10 repetitions. The clock on the left works similarly. It was mostly coding after I got the proper arrangement for the NeoPixel ring. Since it only has 12 units, my units were twelfth of minutes and hours instead of tenths or traditional minutes and seconds. There is no flashing indicator, which simplified the internal counting scheme. It counts 5 seconds, updates the second light, counts 60 of the 5 second intervals, giving a five minute interval for the minute light. Finally, it updates the hour for 12 movements of the minute light. Since it is a circle, it also has to check if the 24 hour time is afternoon, so it knows to repeat back, since there is no 13 or 18 or 24 light on the 12 light ring. This causes a change in the colors for the second and minute hands to signify the it is afternoon. I chose the seven segment design, because it is legible and recognizable, in addition to being much easier to start with than adding the dependency of the NeoPixel library. The NeoPixel still makes for a much more interesting design, so I eventually completed that design as well. The simulator gave me few options with the aesthetic appearance of the first clock, but the NeoPixel has plenty of customization built in, which allowed to be more creative. I used red, green, blue, and white as the light colors, because of their use in all computers, visual harmony, and also because I used my own method to specify colors, which meant that I had to experiment with converting binary values to decimal and getting the exact position of bits correct without having much idea about how the data was being interpreted. The red light is for hours, green and blue switch purposes at noon, but it can be determined in fewer than 5 seconds on average which one is perfoming which timekeeping function. The white light is only a reference point for the 12 o'clock position. As for the other clock, it counts in tenths of minutes and hours with normal characters as you would expect, however, the hours are counted in a strange way. The center horizontal segment is turned off for AM and on for PM. The other lights are all lit except one when the time is between 6 AM and 6PM, and all dark except for one starting at 6 PM and continuing until 6 AM the next day. Now for the precise hour, it is counted going clockwise from the bottom left segment. All permutations of these lighting arrangements are able to count 24 hour distinct units, which fit perfectly with standard hours of the day. There are 6 unique rotational positions, multiplied by 2 for the AM and PM light, which is doubled again, because of the 2 different groupings from 6 AM and PM, which makes 24 permutations possible, so even if I don't explain this well and it's too confusing, you can at least be sure that it indeed works somehow, because I have the math to prove it. It may be hard to fathom how this makes any sense at all, but it should be quite apparent once I  explain it. The purpose(s) of these clocks is to make people think about time in a more meaningful way. We often forget that it is the very important fourth dimension that we live in, and frequently let the time slip away without a second thought. The clocks are intentionally difficult to read with esoteric units and displays for the sake of forcing people to spend a moment pondering the nature of time. Smaller units are not displayed at all without interaction, discouraging people from checking the time obsessively, and helping them concentrate instead of becoming stressed as they watch the seconds tick by. If they really want to see the most accurate time, they have to put forth effort. The larger-than-normal units also force the viewer to try to comprehend the scale of time, and consider our inability to measure time consistently and with perfect precision to infinite decimal places. This leads to questions regarding infinite multiverses and energy and the very definition of time. Ultimately, the byproducts of this are meant to make a positive contribution to life as we know it.<br><i>Test your clock syntax understanding</i><br>What would the clocks look like at 4:20 PM<select><option>Reveal answer</option><option>The first display would have be fully lit, except the bottom right vertical segment, and the second display would show the number three.</option><option>The NeoPixel would have the white light at the top, covered by the green light.
